This application is being setup to utilize the Mythic GM Emulator 2 and various other tools. 

Right now some things that are working are the Event Meaning tables and the newer Event Meaning Element tables complete with rollable tables and even a way to see the tables themselves though that is a work in progress.

I have implemented the Universal NPC Emulator (UNE) also but it is merely rollable at this time and cannot be seen until I figure out showing the tables in a useful way.

Add NPCs does not work as of yet. Looks like an easy fix and oversight that I will get around to. [Fixed]

Threads can be added but not removed but there is a temporary checkbox for if they are completed. I intend to add a function when rolling for the Event Focus that it will use the threads and NPCs in the list to roll against for which thread/NPC the event pertains to.

Fantasy Name Generator is also not working any longer. I have removed most of the code and will attempt to set something up later for it.

The oracle works but does not yet take into account the Chaos Factor as it is always set at 5 for now. I will be changing this based on what I learned trying to implement the r-Level from UNE.
